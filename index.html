            <h1>Paperless Planner</h1>
            <p>Paper planning can be messy. It's so easy to make mistakes that you can’t fix. Sometimes, people can’t draw the types of images they'd like to use. It’s also pretty wasteful; people buy new dated calendars every year. People will be able to abandon their old paper planners and notebooks because it will be more convenient to use Paperless Planner!</p>
            <p>Essentially, Paperless Planner will be a digital journaling/planner application. It will be a place where users can either write (with stylus, Apple Pencil, finger, etc.) or type their checklists, jot down activities or meetings, keep a log of what foods their eating or when they’re exercising, etc. Any type of page that a user might have had in a paper planner will be available or can be integrated into Paperless Planner.  We’ll also offer free stickers and pages, sticker and page packages that users can purchase, and monthly contests where users can submit their own artwork or page layouts through the app. If selected, the winning users will receive a credit to our store and their artwork and layouts will be available for others to use!</p>
