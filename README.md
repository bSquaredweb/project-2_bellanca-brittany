## Project 2 - Part 4

#### Resources
- [CSS-Tricks Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): I am referring to this site for help with Flexbox.
- [CSS-Tricks Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/): This site really is awesome. It helped me understand how to set up my CSS Grid.
- [CSS-Tricks SVG](https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/): I learned that I could look at Illustrator and get the code for SVGs! Neat!
- [CSS Tricks When to Use Button Elements](https://css-tricks.com/use-button-element/): So, when I was validating my code, it said that an `<a>` could not be a child of a `<button>` and vice versa, so I went searching and found this article. It says that we should only use `<button>` inside of `<form>`, so I changed my `<button>` back to `<div>`.

  ##### Plugins
  - [Drawer jQuery Plugin](https://github.com/blivesta/drawer/): A neat plugin for a fairly flexible hamburger navigation.
    - [iScroll Plugin](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll#configuring-the-iscroll): Drawer says it requires iScroll, so iScroll is included as well. ~~I'm hoping to be able to use this for my about page as well.~~ To use iScroll requires a different JS configuration. Looking for an incredibly lightweight smooth scroll plugin for Part 5 or rely on `scroll-behavior`?

#### Deductions
> I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments
- I had to go back and reread and rewatch the class information on CSS Grid. By my questions, you can probably tell that it was not memorable for me and I think that's because we did not do any assignments where we had to use it before this one? Now that I've used it, I absolutely see how wonderful it can be! I did not fully understand it until pretty late in my project, but I enjoyed it so much that I went back and recoded my header and footer because I think it fits better than Flexbox there.


- What I still have left to do
  - Add interactive element to homepage
  - Set up modal
  - Add JS & jQuery
  - Add SVG in
  - Find a lightweight smooth scroll Plugin
  - Set up disabled button on contact form
  - Check over requirements
  - Check over code for DRY, spacing, etc.
