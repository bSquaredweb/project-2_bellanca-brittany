## Project 2 - Part 5

#### Resources
- [CSS-Tricks Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): I am referring to this site for help with Flexbox.
- [CSS-Tricks Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/): This site really is awesome. It helped me understand how to set up my CSS Grid.
- [CSS-Tricks SVG](https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/): I learned that I could look at Illustrator and get the code for SVGs! Neat!
- [CSS-Tricks When to Use Button Elements](https://css-tricks.com/use-button-element/): So, when I was validating my code, it said that an `<a>` could not be a child of a `<button>` and vice versa, so I went searching and found this article. It says that we should only use `<button>` inside of `<form>`, so I changed my `<button>` back to `<div>`.
- [W3Schools - Modals](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp): This site walked me through coding a modal beyond what we did in class (grayed out background, popup look / positioning).
- [W3Schools - `attr()` Method](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/html_attr.asp): I needed help with understanding how to set `disabled` in the `attr()` method.
- [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/learn/2016/12/20/learning-grid-day20/): This video helped me understand how I could set content to overlap with CSS Grid.
[Bubbly](https://leaverou.github.io/bubbly/): This site is a quick helper for making the little arrows to give a rounded rectangle the "speech bubble" look.

  ##### Plugins
  - [Drawer jQuery Plugin](https://github.com/blivesta/drawer/): A neat plugin for a fairly flexible hamburger navigation on each of my three major pages.
    - [iScroll Plugin](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll#configuring-the-iscroll): Drawer says it is dependent on iScroll, so iScroll is included as well, but is only used to support Drawer.
  - [ScrollReveal(a JS plugin)](https://scrollrevealjs.org/): This plugin is used on the Homepage on **mobile** devices (I do have it turned off on desktop devices). It makes the five "bubbles" appear next to their icons under the "Perks" section.

#### Deductions
> I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments
- I think I'm getting pretty close to finishing things up! I have a few more questions that I'll ask during class tomorrow!


- What I still have left to do
  - Add a lightweight smooth scroll Plugin or other jQuery plugin
  - Check over requirements
  - Check over code for DRY, spacing, etc.
  - **Extra idea / stretch goal**: Adjust my custom jQuery so that when user clicks on the circle again, the text box goes away.
