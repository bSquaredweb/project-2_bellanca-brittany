## Project 2 - Part 3

#### Resources
- [CSS-Tricks Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): I am referring to this site for help with Flexbox.
- [Drawer jQuery Plugin](https://github.com/blivesta/drawer/): A neat plugin for a fairly flexible hamburger navigation.
  - [iScroll Plugin](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll#configuring-the-iscroll): Drawer says it requires iScroll, so iScroll is included as well. I'm hoping to be able to use this for my about page as well.

#### Deductions
> I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments
- It's really fun to see the sites come to life. I really appreciate the flexibility you've provided so that we can move through the project in a way that feels right for us.


- For this site, my work flow will look like this:
  - Part 3:
    - Set up navigation & footer
    - Transfer bulk of copy
    - Set up smallest size of size
  - Part 4:
    - Work on responsive design for larger sizes
    - Add interactive element to homepage
  - Part 5:
    - Proof-read
    - Check over spacing, code, variables, etc. per deductions sheet
