## Comments

- As I saw my elements on the web, I decided to make a few changes; I believe my earlier work was not up to my expectations. I really enjoyed seeing my flat images come to life on the web.

- Even though I think I ended up doing a pretty good job on this project, I felt like the combination of using Sass and Flexbox (each for the first time) was a bit overwhelming. For example, I'm still not 100% sure that I put the proper styles in the right pages. I think having separate, smaller assignments on each of these things before this large project would be helpful; students would be able to learn and use each thing before having to combine them in such a large way.

- Looking back, the starter file was absolutely necessary. I would not have been able to put something together that used appropriate mixins and maps. However, I definitely could not recreate the mixins and maps like you did. I think a lesson (from you or on Lynda or some other site) would be helpful here.
